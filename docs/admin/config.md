# DTS Configuration File Specification

You can configure a DTS instance by creating a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) text
file similar to [dts.yaml.example](https://github.com/kbase/dts/blob/main/dts.yaml.example)
in the repository. Typically this file is named `dts.yaml`, and is passed as an
argument to the `dts` executable. Here we describe the different sections in
this file and how they affect your DTS instance.

## Configuration File Sections

Click on any of the links below to see the relevant details for a section.

* [service](config.md#service): configure—ï settings for the DTS web service
  such as the port on which it listens, the maximum number of connections,
  intervals for polling and scrubbing completed tasks, data directories, and
  diagnostics
* [endpoints](config.md#endpoints): configures the endpoints used to transfer
  files from one place to another
* [databases](config.md#databases): configures databases for organizations that
  integrate with the DTS

Each of these sections is described below, with a motivating example.

## `service`

```yaml
service:
  port: 8080
  max_connections: 100
  poll_interval:   60000
  endpoint: globus-local
  data_dir: /path/to/dir
  delete_after: 604800
  debug: true
```
