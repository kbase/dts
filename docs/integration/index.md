# DTS Integration Guide

This document lists all of the things you must do in order to integrate your
database with the BER Data Transfer System (DTS) in order to take advantage of
its file and metadata transfer capabilities.

We have tried to cover all the necessary topics comprehensively here, but
there's no substitute for a real person when confusion arises, so please don't
hesitate to contact the KBase DTS development team with your questions.

## Overview

If you're reading this, you're probably interested in making your data available
to the DTS, and/or being able to receive data from other participating
databases. How exactly does the DTS communicate with these databases?
