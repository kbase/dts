# DTS Globus Endpoint Configuration

The Data Transfer System relies heavily on [Globus](https://www.globus.org/)
for performing file transfers between different databases. Here we describe how
to configure DTS to work with a Globus endpoint.

## 1. Obtain an Application/Service Credential for DTS

## 2. Create a Guest Collection on the Globus Endpoint

## 3. Grant DTS read/write access to the Guest Collection
