# DTS Architecture Decision Records

Here we list all of our design decisions in the form of
[architecture decision records (ADRs)](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record).

Each ADR resides in its own separate Markdown file named
`<imperative-verb>-<noun>`. The content of each ADR follows a simple common
structure, so you can just copy an existing ADR to create a new one.
